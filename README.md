# Week 20 Homework: React Portfolio

This updated portfolio website utilizes React to create routes, components, etc. to render items on the page.


## Business Context

Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, you'll be updating your portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.


## Composition of Application 

* A `Header` (Navbar) component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that is used multiple times on the portfolio page

* Updated portfolio page featuring 6 projects 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third party router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages
